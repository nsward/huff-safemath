# Huff Safemath
A safemath library implemented in [Huff](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/AZTEC/tree/master/packages/huff). A slow work in progress, and primarily an excuse to play around with Huff.

## Usage
`npm install`

#### Run tests
`npm run tests`

#### Compile bytecode
`npm run compile` (not useful bytecode on it's own, as all functions are internal)
